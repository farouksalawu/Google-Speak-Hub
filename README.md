# Google Speak Hub

## What is Google Speak Hub?  
Google Speak Hub is a central dashboard that makes Google’s voice features discoverable, personal, and controllable. It unifies voice interactions across Search, Assistant, Maps, Translate, Gboard, and other apps so you can see, customize, and manage your voice experience in one place.

## Why it matters  
Voice features are powerful but scattered across different apps. Users can speak everywhere, but they have no single view of their voice preferences, history, or privacy settings. Google Speak Hub solves this by giving you:  
- Visibility into which apps used voice recently  
- Easy control over voice privacy and behavior  
- Customizable voice profiles for different scenarios  
- Accessibility-friendly features  

## Who is it for  
- Everyday users who use voice commands frequently  
- Accessibility users who rely on voice for interactions  
- Privacy-conscious users wanting control over voice data  
- Anyone looking for a unified experience across Google apps  

## Key Features  
- **Voice Dashboard:** Quick overview of recent voice activity, active apps, and easy toggles like mute or privacy mode.  
- **Profile & Voice Selector:** Pick your voice persona, adjust tone, speed, and languages, and save profiles for different contexts like Driving or Home.  
- **Unified History & Controls:** Read transcripts of recent interactions with one-tap delete and privacy toggles.  
- **Universal “Speak Mode” Toggle:** Enable quick system-wide voice activation routed to the right handler (Assistant, Search, Maps).  
- **Accessibility Hub:** Adjust text size, readback options, listening sensitivity, and offline command support.
